# TeamGAproject
TeamGAproject is an app that I made for my capstone group project in Community College. We were a goup of five people with different roles. I was assigned as an Application Developer. With this app employee can create an account, display the school information such as; news, address, phone numbers and video, clock in/out time for working hour, and posting news.
